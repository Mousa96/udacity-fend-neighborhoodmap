# Project Description 
From the official project page:
You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
# How To Run

## Note about the application:
You may notice it's kinda slow and laggy a bit when clicking the markers, but that just because of all the debugging functions during production phase to take care of responsive design & error-handling. If you want to achieve a decent speed. comment out every debugging function ( they're indicated in the comments ).
